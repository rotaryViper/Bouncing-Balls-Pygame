Prerequisites: Pygame 2.0

This is a short demonstratation of basic bouncing physics in pygame for educational purposes.
This only works on windows.

Hover your mouse over any part of the screen, hold space bar and watch the spectacle unfold :)

Version 1 was a naive implementation of pygame.
Version 2 attempted to be more efficient than version 1, although to no avail.
